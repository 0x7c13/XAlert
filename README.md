# XAlert - An X-Plane Plugin

XAlert is an X-Plane plug-in that alert user on demand based on distance from current aircraft location to destination airport.
The plugin is still in alpha stage and it will be updated weekly with new features and bug fixes.

## Build

Simply use Visual Studio 2017 to open XAlert.sln from root folder and you are all set! (Visual Studio 2017 Community is free, in case you do not know)

* XCode project will be added later.
